# Readme stuff
 - using JavaFX
 - A visual simulation of bees in the style of John Conways Game of Life.
 - Rule based
 - Simulation

# Thoughts
Should make product more modular
 - split into presentation and "backend"
 - Should still be based on rules, but there should be different scenarios
   - scenarios meaning different "games" where there are different rules and objects
 - Make higher framerate than before, more pleasing for eyes
   - Bees should "flicker" around to move at higher speed but slow pace
