# Readme stuff
 - using JavaFX
 - A visual simulation of bees in the style of John Conways Game of Life.
 - Rule based
 - Simulation

# Thoughts
Should make product more modular
 - split into presentation and "backend"
 - Should still be based on rules, but there should be different scenarios
   - scenarios meaning different "games" where there are different rules and objects
 - Make higher framerate than before, more pleasing for eyes
   - Bees should "flicker" around to move at higher speed but slow pace

# Current/todo
 - implement default scenario
   - base classes are done, just need to utilize/render it
 - generalize and extract things in common with all scenarios
 - implement second scenario with different hive, bee, and flower/pollen-source
   - maybe containing hostile insects? Brainstorm/research
